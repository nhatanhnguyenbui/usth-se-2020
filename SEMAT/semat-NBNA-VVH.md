Representations of the essential things to work with. The Alphas provide descriptions of the kind of things that a team will manage, produce, and use in the process of developing, maintaining and supporting software.
The kernel contains seven key elements - Requirements, Software System, Team, Work, Way of Working, Opportunity and Stakeholders.

### Stakeholders
The people, groups, or organizations who affect or are affected by a software system.

The stakeholders provide the opportunity and are the source of the requirements and funding for the software system. The stakeholders should be involved throughout the software engineering endeavor to support the team and ensure that an acceptable software system is produced.

### Opportunity
The set of circumstances that makes it appropriate to develop or change a software system.

The opportunity articulates the reason for the creation of the new, or changed, software system. It represents the team's shared understanding of the stakeholders' needs and helps shape the requirements for the software system by providing justification.

### Requirements
What the software system must do to address the opportunity and satisfy the stakeholders.

It is important to discover what is needed from the software system, share this understanding among the stakeholders and the team members, and use it to drive the development and testing of the system.

### Software System
A system made up of software, hardware, and data that provides its primary value by the execution of the software.

### Work 
Activity involving mental or physical effort done in order to achieve a result.

In the context of software engineering, work is everything that the team does to get the goals of producing a software system matching the requirements and addressing the opportunity by the stakeholders.

### Team
A group of people engaged in the development, maintenance, delivery or support of a specific software system.

One or more teams plan and perform the work needed to create, update and/or change the software system.

### Way of Working 
The tailored set of practices and tools used by a team to guide and support their work.

The team evolves their way of working alongside their understanding of their mission and their working environment. As their work proceeds they continually reflect on their way of working and adapt it as necessary to their current context.
